Certain design requirements were not specified in the challenge description. So this challenge was tackled using the following assumptions:

- Period of available time is considered 7 days starting the day AFTER the program is run
- Output is largest duration for each corresponding day in the week
- Execute the program by calling returnLargestFreeTime(String filePath)

The program has runtime of O(n).
